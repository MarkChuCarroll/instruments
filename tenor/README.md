# Mini-Tenor Guihar

This is a mini-sized 4-string tenor guitar, intended to be strung using
nylon strings. (Light gauge metal strings _might_ work, but since the
body doesn't have any kind of strength reinforcement, I suspect that
it'll warp. Eventually, I hope to add a carbon-fiber rod to the body, 
which should give it the strength to use metal strings.) 

Everything is printed, _except_:
* a set of tuners with 10mm posts. (I use [these](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0789YL6JF/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_image?ie=UTF8&psc=1).)
* A set of nylon guitar strings.
* A 12 1/4 inch truss rod (I used [this from StewMac](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07HPBZ3NH/ref=ox_sc_act_title_1?smid=A1BA2XBPZFTT2S&psc=1)).

Assembly should be pretty obvious.

I'm printing this from PLA. At least on my Mk4, I find that ABS tends to
end up slightly porous due to adhesion issues, and any leaks have a big
effect on the sound, and PETG flexes too much.
